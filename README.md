## Setup & Installation

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Ensure all files are in the same directory:
   - `index.html`
   - `index.css`
   - `images/profile.jpg`
3. Open `index.html` in your browser

No build process or dependencies required for basic functionality!

## Customization

### Update Personal Information

In `index.html`, modify:
- **Name & Title** - Change the `<h1>` text
- **Bio** - Update the `<p>` description
- **Email** - Change the `mailto:` link in the "Let's Work Together" button

### Styling Changes

Edit `index.css` to customize:
- **Colors** - Modify background, text, and accent colors
- **Fonts** - Change font families or sizes
- **Layout** - Adjust spacing, padding, and dimensions

### Profile Picture
